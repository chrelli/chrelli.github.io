title: Talent prize from the Lundbeck Foundation
---

I was awarded the [Lundbeck Foundation Talent Prize](https://www.lundbeckfonden.com/en/lundbeckfonden-haedrer-blaendende-nye-forskningstalenter/
), a research award of 100,000 DKK, which is given once a year to scientists under the age of 30 who have conducted particularly promising research within the health and medical sciences.

The scientific committee had the following nice things to say about my work:

> Christian Laut Ebbesen is a very promising, young Danish brain researcher. He began his studies in biophysics at the Niels Bohr Institute but quickly became involved in biomedical sciences research. During the course of his PhD in Berlin, Christian studied the way in which neurons in the cerebral cortex code complex stimuli and control behaviour. His latest project involves investigation of the activity in the brain’s motor cortex – more precisely, the significance of the movement of whiskers in the social interactions of rats. Christian has an extensive international network and has presented his work at numerous reputable conferences and high-profile scientific meetings.
