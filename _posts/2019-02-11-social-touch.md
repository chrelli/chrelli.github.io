title: New preprint about cortical processing of social touch
---

We still know very little about how socio-sexual variables are represented at the cellular level in the mammalian neocortex. Recently, I looked at a large dataset of neurons recorded during social facial touch and asked how the social context and ‘meaning’ of touch impacts the neural responses at the single cell and network level. Across multiple cortical regions, social context (partner sex) was a major determinant of single cell responses and population dynamics. In some regions, the neural response pattern also depended on the sex of the subject animal itself (another aspect of 'social context').

Both neurons were recorded from rats engaging in social facial touch with multiple male and female conspecifics. The neuron on the left increases in activity during social facial touch, and more strongly with female than male interaction partners. The neuron on the right decreases in activity when touching male interaction partners, but shows essentially no modulation with female partners. (Black dots indicate single action potentials, pink/blue bars indicate duration of the social touch episodes with female/male partners, trials are sorted by the length of the touch episodes)" %}

Why is this information useful? Many disorders characterized by social dysfunction, such as autism, depression and anxiety disorders, have marked sex differences in prevalence and symptoms. Identifying potential differences in how male and females cortices process social stimuli and encode social context – such as during social touch – could help identify which neural processes underlie healthy social behavior, what goes wrong in disease and point the way towards new treatment options.

By the way, making the preprint look halfway decent in MS Word was a real struggle. I ended up generating a sort of biology preprint template with a bioRxiv–inspired design. I've put the template [on github](https://github.com/chrelli/bioRxiv-word-template). Feel free to download and use it.
