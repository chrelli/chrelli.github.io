title: Postdoctoral fellowship from the Novo Nordisk Foundation
---

I've been awarded a postdoctoral grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation, which will cover my work for the next four years. The awards was presented to me and  the other grant recipients (postdocs, group leaders and clinical researchers in the biomedical sciences) at a celebration, where everyone gave a short presentation about their research projects to an audience that included their family, friends, and research collaborators. Here is a [small writeup from the foundation](http://novonordiskfonden.dk/en/content/novo-nordisk-foundation-awards-grants-worth-dkk-100-million-talented-researchers) about all the grant awardees and their various research projects.
