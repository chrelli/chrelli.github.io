I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [laboratory of Robert Froemke](http://froemkelab.med.nyu.edu/) at [NYU School of Medicine](http://www.neuroscience.nyu.edu/). In my work, I focus on the oxytocin system and use a combination of experimental and computational tools to study and manipulate neural activity during social behavior in mice.

I received my PhD in Neurobiology from the Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin, Germany. I did my doctoral research in the [laboratory of Michael Brecht](https://www.activetouch.de/) at the [Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience](http://www.bccn-berlin.de/) and I was associated with the [Berlin School of Mind and Brain](http://www.mind-and-brain.de/). During my PhD, I worked on the cortical control of rat whisker movements in the context of rat social facial touch and on spatial and temporal coding in parahippocampal cortex. I received my undergraduate degrees in physics/biophysics from the [Niels Bohr Institute](http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/) at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.
